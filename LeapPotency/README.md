#### Dependencies:
- LeapPotency &#8594; ClassicPotency

#### Requirements:
- **LP1** "Clabjects and references with a leap potency of n can be instantiated exactly n meta-levels below, but not at intermediate meta-levels." This is conceptually equivalent to skipping the instantiation of the model element at the intermediate levels. Only nodes and edges can have leap potency.

- **LP2** Classic potency and leap potency cannot be used in conjunction on a model element, as their semantics would overlap.

- **LP3** The leap potency of a model element must be less than or equal to its level (similarly to classic potency).

- **LP4** The potency of a field must be equal to the leap potency of its containing node.

- **LP5** After an instantiation, the potency of the instance node (or edge) and the potency of any contained fields must be 0.
