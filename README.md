This repository contains examples of our Multi-Level Modeling Playground (MLMP), described by the Multi-Level Specification Language (MLSL). The examples consist of the following, separated by different folders:
- common re-usable modules (e.g., BasicModule)
- notion specifications (e.g., ClassicPotency)
- domain specifications (e.g., DomainBicycle)

Where applicable, dependencies and related references can be found separately in every sub folder.
