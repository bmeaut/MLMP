This repository contains examples of our Multi-Level Modeling Playground (MLMP), described by the Multi-Level Specification Language (MLSL). The examples consist of the following, separated by different folders:
- common re-usable modules (e.g., BasicModule)
- notion specifications (e.g., ClassicPotency)
- domain specifications (e.g., DomainBicycle)

Where applicable, dependencies and related references can be found separately in every sub folder.

The repository also contains the brief syntax definition of MLSL described in EBNF.

The examples and this document are subject to change based on researcher feedback and on our own research.
